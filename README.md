# LSTM-question

>Three questions </br >
> * First, according to the web (https://stackabuse.com/time-series-prediction-using-lstm-with-pytorch-in-python/#disqus_thread), I change the data to exchange rate, 
and the value which predicted by the lstm model is a horizontal line. Is my understanding of model or code wrong? </br >

> * The second question is that I want to use GPU to run the model. The code is changed to the mark "change to cuda" in lstmVer2_GPU.ipynb. 
I donâ€™t know if this is correct. </br >

> * Last, the question is the last picture. The shape of data has been changed to 2054 before. Why does it seem to be the original vales(2605)? </br >

## Anyone who knows the above three questions. I will be very appreciate.
